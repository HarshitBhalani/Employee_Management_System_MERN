# 👨‍💼 Employee Management System 

This Employee Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) primary operations to efficiently manage employee data. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, CORS for secure cross-origin resource sharing, and Mongoose for object data modeling. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, ensuring robust and scalable data storage.
